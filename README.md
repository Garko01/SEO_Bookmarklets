# How to use
To set up and use the bookmarklet, follow these steps:

1. **Copy the Code**: Select the code snippet (starting from the specified line) and copy it.
2. **Create a New Bookmark**: Open your bookmarks manager, add a new bookmark, and name it as you like. Then, paste only the code into the URL field. Adding comments may break the bookmarklet.
3. **Save the Bookmark**
4. **Use the Bookmarklet**: Visit the page where you want to use it, then click the bookmarklet from your bookmarks bar. 
   - If a shield icon with an "X" appears near the URL, click it, select "Load Unsafe Scripts," and then click the bookmarklet again. 

Note: Each script is formatted as a single line, as it would appear in the URL field of a bookmarklet.
